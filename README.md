## 💫👾 About this repository 👾💫

![lain-typing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b841f02-4d97-43ce-978f-a341f8c0bc01)

This repository contains projects and exercises completed on DataCamp as part of my
learning process in data science and programming.

The main purpose of this repository is not to serve as a polished portfolio, but as a
personal knowledge base to track my progress, reinforce concepts, and document what I
have learned over time through hands-on practice.

The projects included here cover a variety of topics related to data analysis, data
manipulation, exploratory data analysis, basic machine learning, and programming. Each
project represents a specific learning milestone and may vary in complexity and scope.

This repository reflects my continuous learning journey as a Data Science Engineering
student, where experimentation, iteration, and consistency are key components of growth.
